Title: Conversion of single cell experiment output files to relational database

Description: This package is a follow-up to the `hca` package, a wrapper around
    the API provided by the Human Cell Atlas to access single cell experiment
    output. Here, we dowload sets of `.loom` and `.h5ad` files and extract their
    assay matrices, gene annotations, and cell annotations for representation
    in a relational database structure for easier querying.
